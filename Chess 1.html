        <font color="black" size="5">Chess is a board game between two players. It is sometimes called Western chess or
            international chess to
            distinguish it from related games, such as <b>xiangqi</b> (Chinese chess) and <b>shogi</b> (Japanese chess).
            The
            current form of
            the game emerged in <i>Spain</i> and the rest of Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century
            after evolving
            from <b>chaturanga</b>, a similar but much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's
            most
            popular
            games, played by millions of people worldwide.

            Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a chessboard with 64
            squares
            arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen,
            two
            rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The player who moves first controls white pieces, and the
            other
            controls black pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under
            immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can
            end
            in a
            draw.</font>
